# Mobile Menu

A JavaScript mobile menu for use in external projects.

It's exported as a function named 'newMobileMenu', which requires as arguments the 'triggerItemId', the 'menuItemsContainerId', the 'menuItemsClass' and the 'returnItemId'. There are lots of other customizable options, which can be seen in 'index.js'.

One of three UIModules, the other two being an [Image Slider](https://github.com/heldersrvio/image-slider) and a [Drop-down Menu](https://github.com/heldersrvio/drop-down-menu).
